# cowtools
This repository is my new catch-all repo for my C/C++ programs/projects. Most of them are really small, and I am planning on just having them in the same repo and just organize them into folders.
Below will hopefully be a very short explanation of each of the programs, which I will add as I add the programs here.

### cow tools?
The name is a reference to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_tools) comic.
